# Python Portfolio
This repository contains my portfolio of Python projects revolving around its application in data, including data analytics and data science. I managed this repository for academic, self-learning, and hobby purposes.

_Note: Data used in the projects (accessed under data directory) is for demonstration purposes only._

## Instructions for Running Python Notebooks Locally
1. Install dependencies using requirements.txt
1. If there is a database required to be installed, run the SQL script inside your RBDMS
1. Run notebooks as usual by using Jupyter Notebook server or VSCode, etc.

## Contents
- ### Data Analysis and Visualisation

	- [Northwind Exploratory Data Analysis](https://github.com/owenagitza/Python-Portfolio/tree/main/Northwind_Exploratory_Data_Analysis): Data analysis and visualization of the Northwind database. This is my attempt to incorporate SQL into my data learning. I try to answer business question using data analytics, all of which are focusing on deriving data-driven decisions to improve sales performance of Northwind
		
		_Tools: Matplotlib, SQL, Pandas, Plotly, Seaborn_
- ### Machine Learning

	- [E-Commerce Analytics: Customer Churn Prediction](https://github.com/owenagitza/Python-Portfolio/tree/main/E-Commerce_Analytics.Customer_Churn_Prediction): A supervised classification model to predict customer's churn rate. This notebook provides an end-to-end demonstration of applied machine learning. The scope of topics discussed in this notebook includes ETL, exploratory data analysis, supervised classification, imbalanced dataset problem, data analysis, hyperparameter tuning, threshold moving, etc.

		_Tools: Imblearn, LightGBM, Matplotlib, Pandas, Plotly, Scikit-learn, XGBoost_

- ### Natural Language Processing

	- [Olist E-Commerce Analytics: Sentiment Classification using Machine Learning](https://github.com/owenagitza/Python-Portfolio/tree/main/Olist_E-commerce_Analytics.Sentiment_Classification_using_Machine_Learning): A supervised NLP model that classifies positive and negative reviews. This notebook provides an end-to-end demonstration of **Olist E-commerce analytics: Sentiment classification using machine learning**. The scope of topics discussed in this notebook includes ETL,  exploratory data analysis, and machine learning (supervised NLP classification, imbalanced dataset problem, hyperparameter tuning, threshold moving, etc.)
	
		_Tools: Imblearn, Matplotlib, NLTK, Pandas, Plotly, RegEx, Scikit-learn, Seaborn, XGBoost_

- ### Micro Projects

	- [Simple Operational Program](https://github.com/owenagitza/Python-Portfolio/tree/main/Simple_Operational_Program): This is my first ever program written in Python. This micro project simply is my first stepping stone into the programming world
